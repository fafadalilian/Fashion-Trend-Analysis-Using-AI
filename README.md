# Fashion-Trend-Analysis-Using-AI

This project involves fine-tuning OpenAI's CLIP model to generate text descriptions from fashion images and analyze current fashion trends. Then, the generated descriptions are combined with LLms to offer insight about fashion trends.

## Key Features

- **Image-to-Text Generation**: Fine-tunes the CLIP model to generate accurate and relevant text descriptions from fashion images.
- **Trend Analysis**: Uses the generated descriptions to identify and analyze current fashion trends.


## Next Steps

1. **Exposure to Diverse Images**:
   - Extract images and descriptions from social media platforms and retail websites to diversify the dataset.
2. **Improve Data Collection**:
   - Automate data collection using web scraping and APIs.
3. **Enhance Prompts**:
   - Create specific and comparative prompts to improve trend analysis.
4. **Refine Model Training**:
   - Fine-tune the model with more diverse data and experiment with other models.
